    nova/neutron service check plugins now produces string metrics. When API 
    is down and agents/service cannot reach it, monitoring agent will generate
    a warning of message "cannot reach API" by emitting out a metric with a
    string metric "<service/agent> cannot reach API".  And in other scenarios,
    the plugin will emit "Yes"/"No" metric to indicate service/agent is up/down.
