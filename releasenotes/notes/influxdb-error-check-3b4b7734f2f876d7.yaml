  - If maas_rally is configured to write to an influxdb endpoint, a new metric
    (influxdb_success) and alarm will be created to generate alerts if writing
    to influxdb fails.  A failure to write to influxdb is no longer fatal,
    which allows performance metrics to still be reported via the MaaS API even
    if the influxdb endpoint is unavailable.
