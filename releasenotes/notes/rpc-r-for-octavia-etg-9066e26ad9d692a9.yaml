    This is a barebones script to add RPC-R support for octavia and mk8s
features:
  - |
    'site-osp.yml' will prepare and install octavia and mk8s maas checks
    on an RPC-R environment. This feature is very limited.
issues:
  - |
    After the script is run the maas agent needs to be restarted manually
    for changes taking effect.
