fixes:
  - The maas_common.py is setting OS_VOLUME_API_VERSION and
    OS_IMAGE_API_VERSION with a default of None.  This caused
    calls to get_auth_details to fail a key check for 'None'
    causing nova and neutron checks to fail of those variables
    are not being set in the environment anywhere.
