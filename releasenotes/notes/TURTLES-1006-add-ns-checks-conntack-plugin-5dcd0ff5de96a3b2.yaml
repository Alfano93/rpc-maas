    * The `conntrack_count.py` plugin is now checking for network namespaces
      listed at `/var/run/netns` and retreives the iptables connection
      tracking infomation for each namespace.
      This ensures that embedded network namespaces are alerted in case
      connection tracking hashes are about to exceed a configurable threshold.
      Due to the limited availability of MAAS metrics per alarm, only the
      namespace with the higest connection tracking count is reported.
